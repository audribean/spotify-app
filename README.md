# Exploring Spotify Listening Habits

This project is currently in progress! So far I've managed to export a given playlist to a .csv file using the Spotify API and Python. That .csv gets imported to a Jupyter notebook where I try to find correlations across certain audio features.

I'm currently working on building an interface using React, so others can enter links to their playlists and see the statistics for themselves.
